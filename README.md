**icp-note-take** is a responsive note-taking application built with **React** on the frontend and **Motoko** on the backend, deployed to the **Internet Computer (ICP)**.

Itâ€™s a feature-matching rebuild of my earlier [`note-take`](https://github.com/andrewblais/note-take) project, which used a **Node.js/Express backend with a PostgreSQL database**.

Completed as an assignment for [Angela Yu's WebDev Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/), taking her basic architecture, expanding and modernizing it with my own style and functionality.

- The main difference is that **icp-note-take** stores all data directly on-chain via ICP canisters â€” eliminating the SQL layer entirely while maintaining core note-taking functionality.
- This shift showcases how a traditional full-stack app can be re-architected for decentralized, serverless deployment without sacrificing responsiveness or usability.

## Differences from `note-take`

| Feature / Aspect      | `note-take` (Original)             | `icp-note-take` (This Project)                             |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Backend**           | Node.js + Express                  | Motoko (ICP Canister)                                      |
| **Database**          | PostgreSQL (via pgAdmin)           | On-chain storage via stable variables                      |
| **Hosting**           | Local dev / AWS EC2 + S3 planned   | Internet Computer (`dfx deploy`)                           |
| **API Integrations**  | Dad Jokes API + Quotes API         | Dad Jokes API only (Quotes removed due to ICP CORS limits) |
| **Persistence Layer** | Relational DB tables & SQL queries | In-memory data persisted with stable vars                  |
| **Deployment Flow**   | Node server + React build          | Canister backend + React frontend via asset canister       |
| **Goal**              | Bootcamp capstone (AWS target)     | Integrating React with ICP/Motoko/decentralized deployment |

## Installation/Getting Started

> This project runs on the **Internet Computer** via `dfx`. No SQL database is used.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [Internet Computer SDK](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://ubuntu.com/desktop/wsl)

### WSL Setup Notes (for Windows Users)

Get Ubuntu/WSL working and install:

- Node (via `brew` or nvm)
- DFX SDK
- VS Code WSL extension + Motoko plugin

> WSL setup was non-trivial and required repairing Windows internals and manual linking for Node. Notes are in the full version of this README.

### 1. Project Setup/Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrewblais/icp-note-take.git
cd icp-note-take
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Local Replica

```bash
dfx start --background # `dfx stop` to stop
dfx start # Or just use this and `Ctrl + C` to stop
```

### 3. Deploy Canisters Locally

```bash
dfx deploy
```

### 4. Start DFINITY and Vite servers

```bash
npm start
```

Local site runs at: `http://localhost:3000`

### Deployment Note: Local Replica vs Mainnet

This project is currently configured **only for local development** using the Internet Computer SDK (`dfx`) and a locally running **replica**.
It is **not** connected to the live Internet Computer mainnet (also called the **IC network** or **production network**), so:

- All canisters you deploy with the included instructions exist only on your machine.
- Data is stored locally and is **not persisted on-chain** beyond your local environment.
- No ICP tokens are required or spent.

If you want to deploy this app to the **Internet Computer mainnet**, you will need to:

1. **Get a DFINITY Identity**
   Create or log into an Internet Identity (or other supported identity) that can deploy to mainnet.
    - Docs: [Internet Identity Overview](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ii-spec/)

2. **Acquire ICP Cycles**
   Obtain cycles to pay for mainnet canister deployment and hosting.
    - Docs: [Cycles and Canister Costs](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/production/cycles/)

3. **Update `dfx.json` for Mainnet**
   Configure your canister settings with `network` set to `"ic"` instead of `"local"`.

4. **Deploy to Mainnet**
   Use the following command:

    ```bash
    dfx deploy --network ic
    ```

5. **Handle Live CORS / API Access**
   Some APIs (like `icanhazdadjoke`) may require proxying or CORS workarounds when running on the live IC network.

## Reflections & Pain Points

- Motokoâ€™s type system is stricter than JavaScript, but that leads to fewer runtime surprises.
- Replacing PostgreSQL with stable variables changes how you think about persistence and data modeling.
- ICP canister deployment has a very different dev cycle from a traditional Node + DB stack.
- CORS restrictions on ICP mean some APIs are inaccessible without an intermediary â€” hence [quote](https://github.com/andrewblais/note-take#-add-a-quote) removal.
- The Internet Computer offers built-in asset hosting, so no need for a separate S3 bucket.
- Lots of heavy lifting getting this project to work. Learning Motoko on the fly wasn't easy.
- Angela's course is a bit out of date, but still very useful and educational. Much translation/updating/refactoring of her base code, both frontend and backend was required.
